In this project, I used data from a ten year period to build a model that predicts the unemployment rate for counties in the United States. The data was collected from the USDA site and the US Census Bureau. I analyzed the data and selected features to use in the model, then used several different machine learning algorithms to fit a model. I compared the results, and chose the one with the best performance on the test data. The features used in the model included population, education data, area, year, minimum wage, and CPI. 

The code folder contains all the code that was used for cleaning and analyzing the data, and for building the model. The reports folder contains several reports describing various aspects of the project, including a summary of the results.
